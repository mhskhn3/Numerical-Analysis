Fixed Point Iteration:

1- Fixed point iteration is an iterative numerical method used to find the fixed point of a given function.
2- A fixed point of a function f(x) is a value c for which f(c) = c.
3- The method starts with an initial guess x₀ and repeatedly applies the function f(x) to obtain a sequence of values x₁, x₂, x₃, and so on, until convergence is achieved.
4- The convergence of the fixed point iteration depends on the choice of initial guess and the properties of the function f(x).


Muller's Method:

1- Muller's method is a numerical root-finding algorithm used to find complex roots of a polynomial equation.
2- It is an extension of the secant method and uses quadratic interpolation to approximate the roots.
3- The method requires three initial guesses, x₀, x₁, and x₂, and iteratively computes new approximations x₃, x₄, x₅, and so on, until a desired level of accuracy is reached.
4- Muller's method has the advantage of being able to find both real and complex roots of a polynomial equation.



Horner's Method:

1- Horner's method is an efficient algorithm for evaluating polynomials.
2- It allows the evaluation of a polynomial of degree n with a minimal number of arithmetic operations.
3- The method is based on expressing the polynomial as a series of nested multiplications and additions, avoiding the need for explicitly expanding the polynomial.
4- By rearranging the terms and using a recursive process, Horner's method reduces the number of multiplications and additions required, resulting in faster evaluation of polynomials.
